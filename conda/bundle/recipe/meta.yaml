# NOTE
# This is an attempt to bundle the pdfium binaries with conda packages, like we do for pypi wheels.
# However, conda does not support CPU specific but Python version independent packages, meaning we'd have to build for each Python separately, so the better solution is probably to unbundle pdfium.
# For now, let's retain this passively as a second option just in case a situation arises where bundling would be desired anyway.
