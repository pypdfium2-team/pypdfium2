<details open><summary>Helpers</summary>

</details>
<details open><summary>Setup</summary>

- [ ] This PR changes setup code (`setupsrc/`, `setup.py` etc.).
- [ ] I have read through relevant doc sections [Installation -> From source][1] and [Setup Magic][2].
- [ ] I have tested the change does not break internal callers.
- [ ] I believe the change is maintainable and does not cause unreasonable complexity or code pollution.
- [ ] The change does not try to shift a maintenance burden or upstream downstream tasks. *Keep handlers generic, avoid overly downstream-specific or (for us) effectively dead code passages.*
- [ ] I have assessed that the targeted use case cannot reasonably be satisfied by existing means, such as [Caller-provided data files][3], or the change forms a notable improvement over possible alternatives.
- [ ] I believe the targeted use case is supported by pypdfium2-team. *Note that we may not want to support esoteric or artificially restricted setup envs.*
