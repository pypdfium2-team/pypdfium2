Python API
==========


Preface
*******

Thread incompatibility
----------------------

PDFium is not thread-compatible. If you need to parallelize tasks, use processes instead of threads.


API layers
----------

pypdfium2 provides multiple API layers:

* The raw PDFium API, to be used with :mod:`ctypes` (namespace ``pypdfium2.raw``).
* The support model API, which is a nice set of Python helper classes around the raw API (namespace ``pypdfium2``).
* Additionally, there is the internal API, which contains various utilities that are not fit for the main support model (namespace ``pypdfium2.internal``).

All wrapper objects provide a ``raw`` attribute to access the underlying ctypes object.
In addition, helpers automatically resolve to raw if used as C function parameter. [#ctypes_param_hook]_
This allows you to conveniently use helpers where available, while the raw API can still be accessed as necessary.

The raw API is quite stable and provides a high level of backwards compatibility (seeing as PDFium is
well-tested and relied on by popular projects), but it can be difficult to use, and special care needs
to be taken about memory management.

The support model API is still in development. Backwards incompatible changes may be applied occasionally,
though they are usually limited to major releases. On the other hand, it is considerably easier to use,
and the consequences of usage mistakes are generally less serious.

.. [#ctypes_param_hook] Implemented via ctypes hook `_as_parameter_ <https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#calling-functions-with-your-own-custom-data-types>`_


Memory management

.. note::
   This section covers the support model, which does a lot of protective handling around raw pdfium close functions.
   It is not applicable to the raw API alone!

PDFium objects commonly need to be closed by the caller to release allocated memory. [#ac_obj_ownership]_
Where necessary, pypdfium2's helper classes implement automatic closing on garbage collection using :class:`weakref.finalize`. Additionally, they provide ``close()`` methods that can be used to release memory explicitly.

It may be advantageous to close objects explicitly instead of relying on Python garbage collection behaviour, to release allocated memory and acquired file handles immediately. [#ac_obj_opaqueness]_

Closed objects must not be accessed anymore.
Closing an object sets the underlying ``raw`` attribute to None, which should safely prevent illegal function calls on closed raw handles, though.
Attempts to re-close an already closed object are silently ignored.

Closing a parent object will automatically close any open children (e.g. pages derived from a pdf).
This is a fairly recent change. With older versions, you should be cautious to close all children explicitly before closing a parent object.

It is important to note that raw objects must never be isolated from their wrappers. Continuing to use a raw object after it was closed (explicitly or on garbage collection of the wrapper) is bound to result in a use after free scenario.
Due to limitations in :mod:`weakref`, finalizers can only be attached to wrapper objects, although they would logically belong to the raw objects.

.. [#ac_obj_ownership] Only objects owned by the caller of PDFium need to be closed. For instance, page objects that belong to a page are automatically freed by PDFium, while the caller is responsible for loose page objects.

.. [#ac_obj_opaqueness] Python does not know how many resources an opaque C object might bind.
