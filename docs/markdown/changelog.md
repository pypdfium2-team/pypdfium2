# Changelog


## 0.15.0 (2022-02-28)

- Updated PDFium from `4901` to `4915`.
- Improved build and update scripts:
  * Enhanced Python API accessibility so that the main functions can now be invoked directly,
    without the need for argparse.
  * Simplified code related to platform names and corresponding data directories to achieve
    more flexibility and reduce complexity.
  * Modified commands to ensure that paths or links are properly wrapped in double quotes.
  * Regrouped patches to be operating system specific.
- Updated setup configuration:
  * We are now using `setup_requires` for setup dependencies, rather than a custom `build`
    group in `extras_require`.
  * Explicitly blacklisted Python 3.7.6 and 3.8.1 as incompatible due to a regression in CPython
    that broke ctypesgen-created string handling code.
- Started moving type hints from code into docstrings. This makes the function headers easier
  to read and would help running the library with older versions of Python.


## 0.14.0 (2022-02-21)

- Updated PDFium from `4888` to `4901`.
- Completed support model for PDF boxes (new functions `get_bleedbox()`, `get_trimbox()`,
  and `get_artbox()`)
- Fixed automatic dependency installation for platforms where the Python executable is not
  named `python3`.
- Tweaked wheel tags to improve compatibility. Changed related code that assigns the tags.
- Completely reworked the setup infrastructure to achieve PEP 517 compliance.
  Thanks to Anderson Bravalheri for the invaluable help.
- Improved documentation:
  * Wrote instructions on how to add support for a new platform.
  * Restructured the table of contents.
  * Created a `.readthedocs.yaml` configuration, mainly to make the documentation builder
    use PEP 517 compliant setup.
- General clean-up and lots of minor enhancements.


## 0.13.1 (2022-02-15)

- Fixed a logical issue related to the internal class definitions and imports: `PdfContext`
  should be defined in `opener.py` rather than `classes.py`, since `PdfDocument` already
  requires importing components that use `PdfContext`, causing a possible circularity.
  While the Python interpreter seems to have automatically resolved these conflicts and the
  test suite passed, this has been a logical mistake to be addressed with this patch release.


## 0.13.0 (2022-02-14)

- Updated PDFium from `4874` to `4888`.
- In `render_page()`, the bitmap is now directly initialised with the right colour format,
  rather than always using RGBA and converting afterwards. This is expected to improve performance
  when rendering without alpha channel, in particular for greyscale.
- Installed a new support model class `PdfDocument` on top of the separate helper functions,
  for object oriented document access. This should be easier to use and more like the API of
  other Python PDF libraries.
- Fixed `setup.py` to always call `getdeps` first, before other imports that already require
  packages that `getdeps` should install.
- Restructured platform-specific setup to greatly reduce code duplication.
- Moved setup-related code into an own directory, to be able to use cleaner imports, and to
  avoid messing up the root directory of the repository.
- Adapted the Makefile to setup changes and added documentation commands.
- Improvements related to license files:
  * Made the repository fully compliant with the `reuse` standard.
  * Moved the PDFium wheel license into the `LICENSES/` directory and removed its embedded
    copies of `Apache-2.0` and `BSD-3-Clause` since they are duplicates.
- Fixed link on the PyPI page to point at the stable documentation, not the development build.


## 0.12.0 (2022-02-07)

- Updated PDFium from `4861` to `4874`.
- Restructured file opening to finally address the Windows issues with non-ascii filenames
  by implementing a support model for `FPDF_LoadCustomDocument()`, which allows us to do
  file reading on the Python side if necessary.
  For this purpose, the following changes to opener functions have been made:
  * Added `open_pdf_buffer()` to incrementally load a document from a byte buffer.
  * Added `open_pdf_native()` to load a PDF file, with reading being done in Python natively
    using `open_pdf_buffer()`.
  * Added `open_pdf_auto()`, which will use `FPDF_LoadDocument()` for regular file paths,
    `open_pdf_native()` for non-ascii filepaths on Windows, and `open_pdf_buffer()` for bytes
    or byte buffers.
  * Adapted `PdfContext` to use `open_pdf_auto()`.
  * Marked `open_pdf()` as deprecated. It should not be used anymore and may be removed
    at some point.
- Improved the command line interface to list help and version commands in the main help.
  Also made the internals more flexible to allow multiple names for the same command.
- Moved changelog, dependencies, contributing, and tasks files into `docs/markdown/`.
  They are now included in the Sphinx documentation using `myst-parser`.
- Splitted up support model tests into separate files for improved readability and extensibility.
- Cleaned up some typos, unused variables and excessive imports.


## 0.11.0 (2022-01-31)

- Updated PDFium from `4849` to `4861`.
- Overhauled the command-line interface to group different tasks in subcommands.
  It should be a lot cleaner now; easier to use and extend. These modifications make the
  command-line API incompatible with previous releases, though.
  In the course of this restructuring, the following functional changes were applied:
  * Made rendering output format customisable by providing control over the file extension
    to use, from which the `Pillow` library will be able to automatically determine the
    corresponding encoder.
  * Changed the rendering parser to accept multiple files at once.
  * Positional arguments are now used for file input.
  * Added CLI commands for merging PDFs and performing page tiling (N-up).
  * Temporarily removed support for working with encrypted PDFs while we are looking for a
    suitable way to take passwords of multiple files.
- Adapted documentation to the CLI changes.
- When opening from a byte buffer, any object that implements the `.read()` method is now
  accepted (previously, only `BytesIO` and `BufferedReader` were supported). Note that we
  do not automatically seek back to the start of the buffer anymore.
- Restructured installing the exit handler, so that its function is no longer inadvertently
  part of the public namespace.
- Removed the `None` defaults of the table of contents helper class `OutlineItem`. The
  parameters are now passed at construction time.
- Greatly improved `setup.py`: Formerly, running `pip3 install .` always triggered a source
  build, on behalf of platforms for which no wheel is available. With this release, the code
  was changed to detect the current platform and use pre-compiled binaries if available, with
  source build only as fallback.
- On setup, the version file is now always read literally (i. e. without importing the module),
  which makes it a lot less prone to errors.
- Modernised the update script code that reads and writes the version file.
- Added notes concerning the need for a recent version of pip when installing from source.
  Tried to improve compatibility with older releases in the scope of what is possible.
  See also [issue #56](https://github.com/pypdfium2-team/pypdfium2/issues/56).
- Added test cases to ensure existence of version aliases and correctness of CLI entry point
  configuration.
- Updated the Makefile.
- Removed KDevelop project files from the repository.


## 0.10.0 (2022-01-24)

- Updated PDFium from `4835` to `4849`.
- Completely rearranged the internal structure of the support model.
  The public API should be mostly unaffected by these changes, however.
- Adapted documentation and tests to the support model changes.
- Modifications to exceptions:
    * `LoadPdfError` and `LoadPageError` were removed. The more general `PdfiumError` is now
      raised instead. This is because the exception handler may be used universally for more
      situations than just loading PDF documents or pages.
    * `PageIndexError` was replaced with `IndexError`. A custom exception seemed unnecessary
      for this case.
- New support models added:
    * Function `save_pdf()` to create a PDF file from an `FPDF_DOCUMENT` handle. This is
      demonstrated in the example [`merge_pdfs.py`](../../examples/merge_pdfs.py).
    * Methods `get_mediabox()` and `get_cropbox()` to retrieve PDF boxes of an `FPDF_PAGE`.
    * Made the utility functions `translate_viewmode()` and `translate_rotation()` public.
- Removed the in-library logging setup as it could cause issues for downstream users who wish
  to configure the pypdfium2 logger.
- Started backporting PyPDFium2 to older Python versions by removing all uses of f-strings,
  keywords-only enforcement, and `pathlib` across the package. The minimum required Python
  version is now 3.5. (It might be possible to further reduce the requirement by moving type
  hints from the actual code into docstrings.)
- Minor optimisations have been made to the table of contents helper functions.
- Improved build scripts.
- Adapted the update script to upstream changes (thanks @bblanchon).
- Moved some scripts from the root directory into `utilities/` and changed the Makefile
  accordingly.
- Added a list of future [tasks](./tasks.md) to keep in mind.

Tracking changes started with version 0.10.0, so there are no entries for older releases.
