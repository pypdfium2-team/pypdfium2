# Changelog for next release

- Full support model rewrite. Many existing features changed and new helpers added. Numerous bugs fixed on the way.
  Read the updated documentation to migrate your code.
- The raw API is now isolated in a separate namespace (`pypdfium2.raw`).
  Moreover, the raw API bindings do not implicitly encode strings anymore (pypdfium2 is now built with a patched version of ctypesgen by default).
- Helper objects now automatically resolve to the underlying raw object if used as ctypes function parameter.
- Improved command-line interface.
- Improved documentation.
