# Changelog for next release
- `PdfPage.get_objects()`: Don't register pageobjects as children, because they don't need to be closed by the caller when part of a page. This avoids excessive caching of weakrefs that are not cleaned up with the object they refer to.
- Autorelease: Swapped default condition for minor/patch update, as pypdfium2 changes are likely more API-significant than pdfium updates. Added ability for manual override.
- Fixed conda packaging: It is now required to explicitly specify `-c defaults` with `--override-channels`, presumably due to an upstream change.
- Bumped workflows to Python 3.12.
