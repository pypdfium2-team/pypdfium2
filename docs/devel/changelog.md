# Changelog


## 4.21.0 (2023-10-11)

- Updated PDFium from `6002` to `6056`.
- `PdfTextPage.get_text_range()`: Correct the allocation in case of excluded/inserted chars, modify scope to prevent pdfium from reading beyond `range(index, index+count)` (which otherwise it does with leading excluded chars). Update docs to note the two different representations. Thanks to Nikita Rybak for the discovery ({issue}`261`).

- Setup changes (partly ported from the devel branch)
  * ctypesgen fork: replaced the old, bloated library loader with a new, lean version
  * Merged `$PDFIUM_VERSION` and `$PDFIUM_USE_V8` into the existing `$PDFIUM_PLATFORM` specifier (see Readme for updated description). The relatively minor setup API breakage was considered tolerable; the core library API is not affected.
  * Removed the `build` package from pyproject buildsystem requires, where it was unnecessary. Thanks to Anaconda Team.
  * Split in two separate modules: pypdfium2 for helpers (pure-python), pypdfium2_raw for the core bindings (data files).

- Switched PyPI upload to "trusted publishing" (OIDC), which is considered safer. Further, the core maintainers have set up 2FA as requested by PyPI.

*Note: Earlier releases may fail to install from source due to API-breaking changes to our ctypesgen fork (see {issue}`264`). Where possible, avoid source installs and use the wheels instead (the default behavior). If you actually have to do this, consider `--no-build-isolation` and pre-installed dependencies, including ctypesgen prior to commit `61c638b`.*

*Warning: musllinux wheels prior to pdfium-binaries `6043` might be invalid.*


## 4.21.0b1 (2023-09-14)

- Updated PDFium from `5989` to `6002`.


## 4.20.0 (2023-09-10)

- Updated PDFium from `5975` to `5989`.
This release backports some key fixes/improvements from the development branch:
- [V8/XFA] Fixed XFA init. This issue was caused by a typo in a struct field. Thanks to Beno√Æt Blanchon.
- [ctypesgen fork] Prevent setting nonexistent struct fields.
- [V8/XFA] Expose V8/XFA exclusive members in the bindings file by passing ctypesgen the pre-processor defines in question.
- Fixed some major non-API implementation issues with multipage rendering:
  * Avoid full state data transfer and object re-initialization for each job. Instead, use a pool initializer and exploit global variables. This also makes bytes input tolerable for parallel rendering.
  * In the CLI, use a custom converter to save directly in workers instead of serializing bitmaps to the main process.
- Set pdfium version fields to unknown for `PDFIUM_PLATFORM=none` (sdist). This prevents encoding a potentially incorrect version. Also improve CLI version print.
- Fixed sourcebuild with system libraries.
- Fixed RTD build (`system_packages` option removal).
- Attempt to fix automatic GH pages rebuild on release.


## 4.19.0 (2023-08-28)

- Updated PDFium from `5868` to `5975`.
- Reset main branch to stable and shifted v5 development to a branch, so that pdfium updates (and possibly bug fixes) can still be handled.
  v5 development is delayed and unexpectedly tough, so this seemed necessary.
  The automated schedule has been slowed down from weekly to monthly for the time being.
  Further manual releases may be triggered as necessary.


## 4.18.0 (2023-07-04)

- Updated PDFium from `5854` to `5868`.


## 4.17.0 (2023-06-27)

- Updated PDFium from `5841` to `5854`.


## 4.16.0 (2023-06-20)

- Updated PDFium from `5827` to `5841`.


## 4.15.0 (2023-06-13)

- Updated PDFium from `5813` to `5827`.
- In helpers, closing a parent object now automatically closes the children to ensure correct order.
  This notably enhances safety of closing and absorbs the common mistake of closing a parent but missing child close calls. See commit [eb07605](https://github.com/pypdfium2-team/pypdfium2/commit/eb07605fcac124b4fe68f6baf60c86183170d259) for more info.
- In `init_forms()`, attempt to call `FPDF_LoadXFA()` and warn on failure, though as of this writing it always fails.


## 4.14.0 (2023-06-06)

- Updated PDFium from `5799` to `5813`.


## 4.13.0 (2023-05-30)

- Updated PDFium from `5786` to `5799`.


## 4.12.0 (2023-05-23)

- Updated PDFium from `5772` to `5786`.


## 4.11.0 (2023-05-16)

- Updated PDFium from `5758` to `5772`.
- In `PdfDocument.render()`, fixed a bad `bitmap.close()` call that would lead to a downstream use after free when using the combination of foreign bitmap and no-copy conversion. Using foreign bitmaps was not the default and expressly not recommended.


## 4.10.0 (2023-05-09)

- Updated PDFium from `5744` to `5758`.


## 4.9.0 (2023-05-02)

- Updated PDFium from `5731` to `5744`.


## 4.8.0 (2023-04-25)

- Updated PDFium from `5715` to `5731`.
- `PdfTextPage.get_rect()`: Added missing return code check and updated docs regarding dependence on `count_rects()`.
  Fixed related test code that was broken but disabled by accident (missing asserts). Thanks to Guy Rosin for reporting {issue}`207`.
- Added `PdfImage.get_size()` wrapping the new pdfium function `FPDFImageObj_GetImagePixelSize()`, which is faster than getting image size through the metadata.
- `build_pdfium.py --use-syslibs`: Changed `sysroot="/"` (invalid) to `use_sysroot=false` (valid). This allows us to remove a botched patch.


## 4.7.0 (2023-04-18)

- Updated PDFium from `5705` to `5715`.
- Fixed `PdfPage.remove_obj()` wrongly retaining the page as parent in the finalizer hierarchy.


## 4.6.0 (2023-04-11)

- Updated PDFium from `5692` to `5705`.


## 4.5.0 (2023-04-04)

- Updated PDFium from `5677` to `5692`.
- In pdfium-binaries, forms init for V8/XFA enabled builds was fixed by correctly setting up XFA on library init
  (see [pdfium-binaries#105](https://github.com/bblanchon/pdfium-binaries/issues/105)).
  Updated pypdfium2's support model accordingly.


## 4.4.0 (2023-03-28)

- Updated PDFium from `5664` to `5677`.


## 4.3.0 (2023-03-21)

- Updated PDFium from `5648` to `5664`.
- Fixed forms rendering in the multi-page renderer by initializing a formenv in worker jobs if the triggering document has one.


## 4.2.0 (2023-03-14)

- Updated PDFium from `5633` to `5648`.
- API-breaking changes around forms code, necessary to fix conceptual issues. Closes {issue}`182`.
  * `may_init_forms` parameter replaced with `init_forms()`, so that a custom form config can be provided.
  * `formtype` attribute replaced with `get_formtype()`.
    Previously, `formtype` would only be set correctly on formenv init, which caused confusion
    for documents that have forms but no formenv was initialized.
- `PdfPage.get_*box()` functions now provide an option to disable fallbacks. Closes {issue}`187`.
- Some formerly hidden utilities are now exposed in the new namespace `pypdfium2.internal`.


## 4.1.0 (2023-03-07)

- Updated PDFium from `5619` to `5633`.
- The `PdfDocument` parameter `may_init_forms` is now False by default.


## 4.0.0 (2023-02-28)

- Updated PDFium from `5579` to `5619`.
- Full support model rewrite. Many existing features changed and new helpers added. Numerous bugs fixed on the way.
  Read the updated documentation to migrate your code.
- The raw API is now isolated in a separate namespace (`pypdfium2.raw`).
  Moreover, the raw API bindings do not implicitly encode strings anymore (pypdfium2 is now built with a patched version of ctypesgen by default).
- Helper objects now automatically resolve to the underlying raw object if used as ctypes function parameter.
- Overhauled the code base to use `pathlib` and f-strings.
- Updated wheel tags.
- Improved command-line interface, setup code, and documentation.


## 4.0.0b2 (2023-02-23)

- First successful beta release for v4.


## 4.0.0b1 (2023-02-22)

- Attempted beta release for v4. PyPI upload failed due to {issue}`177`.


## History

pypdfium2 is on PyPI since Dec 3, 2021. New versions have been released on a regular basis ever since.

There have been the following version ranges: `0.1 - 0.15`, `1.0 - 1.11`, `2.0 - 2.11`, `3.0 - 3.21.1`.

Entries for releases below version 4 have been removed from the changelog because they were too inconsistent.
