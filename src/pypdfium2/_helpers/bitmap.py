    Warning:

    Attributes:

            The underlying PDFium bitmap handle.
        buffer (~ctypes.c_ubyte):
            A ctypes array representation of the pixel data (each item is an unsigned byte, i. e. a number ranging from 0 to 255).
        width (int):
            Width of the bitmap (horizontal size).
        height (int):
            Height of the bitmap (vertical size).
        stride (int):
            Number of bytes per line in the bitmap buffer.
            Depending on how the bitmap was created, there may be a padding of unused bytes at the end of each line, so this value can be greater than ``width * n_channels``.
        format (int):
            PDFium bitmap format constant (:attr:`FPDFBitmap_*`)
        rev_byteorder (bool):
            Whether the bitmap is using reverse byte order.
        n_channels (int):
            Number of channels per pixel.
        mode (str):
            The bitmap format as string (see `PIL Modes`_).
